# My-Pizza-Shop-Using-React-

This is a pizza menu page that I created using React. 
A preview of the page is attached here:

You may have a taste of authentic Italian cuisine at this very shop! Customers may choose from 6 of the menu items displayed (be quick before it sells out). For more information on the operation hours of the shop, please check out the web menu yourself :P
